Data Stucture called a linked list 
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

Sizeof() it tells you the size in bytes of a data variable

* FIND AN EXCERCISE TO PRACTICE POINTERS WITH LINKED LISTS

data_type *pointer_name

here data type refers to the type of value the the pointer will point to 

For example

int *ptr  points to an integer value
char *ptr points to a char value 
float *ptr points to a float value

Simply declarign a pointer is not enough so we first need to intialise a pointer 
One way to intialisse a pointer is to asign address of some variable
